# Track G0 — governance control and evidence register

**Baseline date:** 2026-11-12  
**Status:** G0–G7 engineering control framework implemented in repository at draft/partial maturity; formal Track G acceptance remains OPEN.  
**Authority:** Owner instruction to execute G; D-023 sequence R → S → I → P → G → U.  
**Scope:** research-only software governance. This register is not an approval, certification, legal opinion, ethics determination or independent review.

## Status vocabulary

- **IMPLEMENTED:** repository artifact or code exists.
- **AUTOMATED-CHECK:** an automated check exists; exact-head result must be cited separately.
- **PARTIAL:** some engineering controls exist, but required scope or evidence is incomplete.
- **OPEN:** evidence, implementation, review or decision is missing.
- **NOT-APPLICABLE (JUSTIFIED):** documented rationale and accountable reviewer are recorded.
- **ACCEPTED:** named authority has made and recorded the decision. Never infer acceptance from a draft, schema or green CI.

An item remains OPEN when evidence is absent, stale, unreviewed, ambiguous or not linked to the exact release/commit. Draft and partial controls do not count as accepted.

## Role assignments

See [accountability and review cadence](roles-and-review-cadence.md). The repository owner (GitHub: AssayFlux) is the only role identified by repository ownership. Engineering, security, scientific, privacy, quality, data, release and publication roles remain unassigned pending explicit appointments. Independent reviewers must be external to the work they assess.

## Current blockers and non-delegable evidence

1. **P0:** remains BLOCKED / NOT APPROVED. No patient/clinical data, human-subject work, individual PGx interpretation, Clinical Mode or regulated deployment.
2. **Independent scientific validation:** synthetic software concordance is not biological/clinical validation.
3. **Legal/licensing/privacy/ethics:** repository changes cannot substitute for qualified advice, source-specific license decisions or competent ethics determinations.
4. **Independent security review:** no independent penetration/mobile security assessment is recorded.
5. **Device evidence:** CI build/JVM tests do not establish physical-device runtime, lifecycle, accessibility or performance.
6. **Publication:** a paper cannot claim novelty, best-in-class performance, accuracy or impact without reproducible evidence and current comparison.
7. **Operations:** incident tabletop, access review and backup/recovery exercises have not been performed or recorded.

## Review cadence and evidence retention

- Review this register at every track exit and before every public release or manuscript submission.
- Review open controls, roles, vulnerabilities, dependencies, CAPA and P0 boundary monthly while development is active.
- Every status change must include date, reviewer/authority, exact commit or artifact, evidence URI, scope and limitations.
- External evidence must record issuing organisation/person, credentials/authority where relevant, date, scope, version, limitations and permission to retain/share the report.
- Never create fictitious incidents, CAPAs, reviews, test outcomes, appointments or approvals. An empty register means no record has been entered, not that no defects exist.
