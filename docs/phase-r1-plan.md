# R1 — Android and scientific-stack feasibility

**Roadmap item:** Track R / R1  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS — latest exact-source CI run #2033 built arm64 APK/AAB and passed static alignment plus Android JVM task; runtime/scientific feasibility remains open  
**Owner:** Engineering + Project owner  
**Started:** 2026-11-07  
**Depends on:** R0 foundation and approved direction baseline  
**Exit gate:** Evidence-backed feasibility matrix and explicit owner go/no-go before declaring R1 validated or opening Track S. Owner has authorized parallel R1–R10 implementation.

## Objective

Establish whether the approved Android-native architecture can support the required scientific stack on Android 10+ arm64 devices, with honest limits for memory, startup, storage, offline operation, native ABI compatibility and scientific correctness. R1 is a feasibility phase, not a product-release claim.

## Owner instruction — build and test workflow

Updated 2026-11-08 with explicit owner authorization:
- GitHub Actions is authorized to build unsigned arm64 debug APK/AAB artifacts and run repository automated checks, including Android JVM unit-test tasks and static APK/ELF alignment checks. Latest successful build run #1721 is recorded in docs/ci-build-evidence.md; the JVM test task was NO-SOURCE at that commit. A new responsive navigation unit test is now present and must pass in a subsequent run.
- The Actions Android build runs on a pinned Linux x86_64 host toolchain, not on the owner's ARM64 phone. It is a reproducible build/test lane, not a claim that Termux can host the build.
- Physical-device testing remains a separate required activity. CI success does not establish app launch, JNI/Python runtime behavior, SAF behavior, background execution or device compatibility on the owner's phone.
- Keep exact run URLs/IDs, source SHA, toolchain versions, logs, artifact hashes/sizes and test results in the feasibility record.
- Never describe a CI build as a local Termux build or claim physical-device tests passed without actual device evidence.

## Required feasibility work

1. **Android baseline:** document Gradle/AGP/Kotlin/SDK/NDK/JDK versions, Compose shell, min SDK 29, arm64-v8a ABI, local build reproducibility and APK/AAB size.
2. **Embedded Python:** test pinned Python, Biopython (SeqIO, Bio.PDB, PairwiseAligner), NumPy and SciPy availability/packaging. Resolve SciPy or document a clearly scoped alternative only after owner approval.
3. **Rust:** compile the planned Android arm64 library, invoke through the real app FFI boundary, and test correctness, errors, cancellation and resource limits.
4. **C++17/JNI:** build and invoke the JNI bridge; retain host-side correctness tests and inspect native ABI/alignment.
5. **Scientific sequence engine:** cross-build and test a real engine such as Parasail only after pinned source, license, ABI, algorithmic test vectors and maintenance costs are reviewed. Biopython's PairwiseAligner smoke test alone does not complete this criterion.
6. **Chemistry engine:** evaluate RDKit or a viable alternative, including transitive licenses, Android buildability, binary footprint, supported operations and reference test vectors.
7. **Offline structure viewer:** package Mol* or an alternative as local assets and test loading a known structure with networking disabled; record WebView/WebGL limitations and worker behavior.
8. **Android file and lifecycle constraints:** assess SAF import, background execution, cancellation, restart/resume, offline behavior, cold start and peak memory.
9. **16 KB support:** inspect all packaged ELF objects and APK alignment, then distinguish static alignment evidence from runtime behavior on a 16 KB Android kernel.
10. **Licensing:** complete file-level and transitive dependency license audits before any production redistribution decision.

## Existing evidence (historical; not a phase pass)

- CI run 1471 built an arm64 debug APK/AAB, cross-compiled Rust, linked the C++17 JNI bridge, and passed static ELF 16 KB alignment and APK ZIP alignment checks. Its artifact hashes and measurements are retained in `docs/android-feasibility.md`.
- CI run 1481 repeated the arm64 APK/AAB build and static alignment checks.
- These records establish historical cross-build, packaging and static alignment only. They do not establish a fresh local build, Android runtime execution, physical-device compatibility, scientific-engine feasibility, cold-start or peak memory.
- Biopython 1.88 custom arm64 wheel was built in the historical CI experiment. Gradle now pins NDK 28.2.13676358 to match the local build script. The local build script verifies the official Gradle 8.13 binary SHA-256 and pins Chaquopy 17.2.0 to immutable commit 1f63c93d8beaf7062fbe51888ab9235475df3bb8. SciPy is used by the pinned host-only numerical reference workflow; availability/packaging in the embedded Android runtime remains unresolved.
- Rust/C++ JNI symbols were present in the historical APK; successful invocation on an Android device is not established.
- Parasail, RDKit and Mol* remain evaluation candidates, not approved production dependencies.

## Evidence protocol

Record exact source revision, toolchain and dependency versions, license status, command, output/log, artifact hash/size, device model/SoC/RAM/Android/API/ABI/page size, repeated timing/memory measurements, pass/fail/blocked result, limitations and reproduction instructions. Emulator evidence never substitutes for physical-device evidence. Static ELF inspection never substitutes for runtime testing.

## Device scope

D-006 sets the target at Android 10+ (API 29), 64-bit ARM (arm64-v8a), with low-end, mid-range and flagship test tiers. This is a target, not a verified compatibility claim. Owner identified a Motorola Moto G54 5G as the first physical test handset on 2026-11-08. Device testing is a separate required D-016 verification step, not deferred until a later blanket test campaign. Keep those rows NOT RUN/BLOCKED until an exact CI artifact is installed and exercised on the owner device with recorded logs. Capture exact Android/API, SoC, RAM, ABI and page size from the connected phone.

## Deliverables

- `docs/android-feasibility.md`: experiment matrix, historical evidence, current blockers, local build procedure and eventual owner-device runbook.
- Minimal isolated prototypes for each R1 feasibility question; the app shell now exposes a manual embedded-Python and Rust/C++ JNI smoke-probe action. The Chaquopy source set explicitly includes the repository's `python/` package, and the runtime probe now imports `kinetics` and exercises FASTA parsing plus reference-checked variant normalization. No prototype is silently promoted to production.
- `docs/third-party.md`: exact dependency versions, source/license review and approval status.
- A consolidated go/no-go matrix with feasible, infeasible, conditional or untested outcomes.

## Exit criteria

R1 is complete only when:
1. Android arm64 local build is reproduced and its APK/AAB contents, size and hashes are recorded.
2. Embedded Python/Biopython/NumPy runtime behavior and the Android SciPy availability/packaging decision are evidenced on a target device; host-only SciPy validation is not a substitute.
3. Rust FFI and C++ JNI calls are executed and verified on Android.
4. A real scientific sequence engine is built and tested against reference vectors.
5. RDKit or an alternative and the offline viewer have measured outcomes.
6. SAF, background work, cancellation/resume, cold-start, memory and offline constraints have evidence or explicit owner-approved scope.
7. 16 KB static and runtime evidence are distinguished and recorded.
8. Dependency redistribution risks and licenses are audited.
9. The go/no-go matrix and limitations are reviewed and explicitly approved by the owner.

**R2 remains blocked until R1 evidence is complete and the owner approves the R1 go/no-go.**
