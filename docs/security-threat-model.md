# Kinetics security and privacy threat model

**Status:** consolidated engineering threat model; not independently reviewed or certified.  
**Scope:** Android Research Mode, local import/storage/export, SQLite and WorkManager, Python/native runtimes, WebView, data packs, build supply chain and explicitly disabled optional remote boundaries.  
**Owner:** project owner must appoint a security role; see [Track G roles](track-g/roles-and-review-cadence.md).

## 1. Security objectives and invariants

- Preserve confidentiality and integrity of user-provided research files and derived outputs.
- Keep local workflows offline by default; no upload, telemetry or remote processing is enabled by this threat model.
- Treat user-selected files, SAF providers, data packs, metadata, URI values, parser inputs and all dependency artifacts as untrusted.
- Keep plaintext, keys, tokens and sensitive paths out of logs.
- Authenticate encrypted content; reject unknown versions and authentication failures without downgrade.
- Never load executable code or native libraries from data packs.
- Do not claim secure deletion on flash storage or deletion of copies previously exported.
- Keep patient/clinical data, human-subject workflows, individual clinical interpretation and Clinical Mode prohibited while P0 is NOT APPROVED.
- Treat a checksum as integrity evidence, not proof of publisher identity or redistribution rights.

## 2. Assets

| Asset ID | Asset | Confidentiality / integrity concern |
|---|---|---|
| A-01 | Imported sequence, structure, chemistry and other research files | Disclosure, tampering, malicious payload, loss |
| A-02 | Decrypted working buffers and temporary files | Residual plaintext after crash/cancel |
| A-03 | Keystore keys and encrypted chunks | Key compromise/loss, nonce/AAD misuse, rollback |
| A-04 | SQLite job, provenance and result metadata | Tampering, stale state, path/URI confusion |
| A-05 | Data-pack manifests and payloads | Substitution, malformed content, rollback, unlicensed redistribution |
| A-06 | Python, Rust, C++, Kotlin and WebView runtime | Memory safety, injection, parser abuse, bridge escalation |
| A-07 | Build inputs, toolchains, dependencies and artifacts | Supply-chain compromise, unreviewed licenses, provenance gaps |
| A-08 | CI credentials and future signing material | Repository/CI compromise and unauthorized release |
| A-09 | User-exported results | Unintended disclosure outside app-controlled storage |

## 3. Trust boundaries and attack surfaces

1. **SAF/document providers:** external content, MIME types, filenames, URI grants and provider behavior are untrusted and may change or be revoked.
2. **Import/parsing:** byte streams, metadata, formats, lengths, compression and parser state are attacker-controlled; enforce streaming and resource ceilings.
3. **Persistence:** WorkManager input, SQLite rows, encrypted file headers, chunk metadata, cache paths and migration state must be validated before filesystem access.
4. **Cryptographic boundary:** Android Keystore and AES-GCM protect app-private ciphertext; key invalidation, backup/restore and device compromise remain risks.
5. **Runtime boundary:** Python packages, Rust/C++ native code, WebView HTML/JS and bridge messages require constrained interfaces and bounded inputs.
6. **Data-pack boundary:** manifests and checksums can detect corruption but do not authenticate a publisher without a verified signature/trust root.
7. **Build/supply-chain boundary:** Gradle plugins, Maven artifacts, PyPI wheels, Cargo crates, NDK/CMake and downloaded tools are untrusted until pinned, hashed and reviewed.
8. **Export boundary:** SAF export intentionally sends user-selected content to an external provider/location; the app cannot control subsequent copies.
9. **Remote boundary:** the source Android manifest currently declares no INTERNET permission. Any future network/remote-node feature is a new trust boundary requiring separate permission, consent, protocol, privacy and security review.

## 4. Threat register

| Threat ID | Threat | Existing / intended control | Residual risk and verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Malformed or oversized import exhausts memory/CPU/storage | Streaming parsers, explicit byte/record caps, negative tests | Parser-specific fuzzing, CPU/memory profiling and device tests open |
| T-02 | URI traversal, provider substitution or revoked permission | SAF grants, UUID job IDs, canonical app-private path checks | Provider revocation, symlink/race and OEM provider tests open |
| T-03 | Ciphertext/chunk tampering or downgrade | AES-GCM authentication, job/chunk AAD, strict version checks | Key invalidation, nonce lifecycle and recovery tests open |
| T-04 | Process death/cancel leaves plaintext or inconsistent DB/files | WorkManager recovery and encrypted partial retention | Fault injection at every transition and orphan reconciliation open |
| T-05 | Data-pack substitution or rollback | Manifest checks, bounded copy, checksum, immutable installed versions | Publisher signature/trust-root policy and rollback tests open |
| T-06 | Sensitive content leaks through logs/errors | No-content logging rule and privacy requirements | Static scan plus runtime logcat review open |
| T-07 | WebView script/bridge injection | Offline assets, typed allow-list bridge and origin policy | Bridge fuzzing, CSP/origin tests and device review open |
| T-08 | Malicious dependency or compromised build input | Version pins, source inventory, CI and artifact hashes | Resolved transitive SBOM, artifact hashes/signatures and independent review incomplete |
| T-09 | Lost/stolen/rooted device exposes data | Keystore-backed encryption and app-private storage | Root/instrumentation/OS compromise, screenshot and lock behavior need device review |
| T-10 | Export sends confidential content to unintended destination | Explicit user-selected SAF action | Destination confirmation, partial-write and user disclosure tests open |
| T-11 | Backup/restore or key loss causes disclosure or irreversible loss | Source manifest sets allowBackup=false | Merged-manifest/OEM/Keystore invalidation tests open |
| T-12 | Unauthorized remote processing or data exfiltration | No INTERNET permission in inspected source manifest; network off by default | Verify merged manifest and runtime traffic; any network addition reopens G1/G4 |
| T-13 | Malicious intent/clipboard/overlay surface | Minimise exported components and sensitive clipboard use | Merged-manifest audit and interaction tests open |
| T-14 | Supply-chain license/security obligations missed | Candidate-only third-party register and source SPDX inventory | Exact resolved artifact and file-level review open |

## 5. Security control mapping

- **G1-01:** this document is the canonical cross-stack threat model. UI-specific cases are maintained in [the UI threat supplement](../governance/threat-model.md), not as a competing full threat model.
- **G1-02:** [security verification matrix](track-g/security-verification-matrix.md) records abuse cases, expected outcomes and evidence status.
- **G1-03:** [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) defines current reporting guidance; operational response procedures are in [Track G operational controls](track-g/operational-controls.md). Private reporting route and triage ownership are not yet tested/assigned.
- **G1-04:** independent mobile/application security assessment and retest are mandatory before release.

## 6. Mandatory test scenarios

Test with synthetic/non-personal data only:
- malformed, oversized, truncated and adversarial parser inputs;
- URI revocation, path traversal, symlink/race and provider substitution;
- concurrent scheduling, cancellation, retry, process death and DB/file crash boundaries;
- Keystore invalidation, reinstall, restore and authentication failure;
- interrupted SAF export and destination-provider failure;
- WebView bridge wrong-origin, wrong-type, oversized and replayed messages;
- manifest permission/exported-component audit and runtime network capture;
- dependency substitution, stale artifact, data-pack rollback and checksum tampering.

Every result must record source commit, APK/AAB digest where applicable, test/tool version, device/API/ABI, input fixture digest, raw output, reviewer and limitations.

## 7. Explicit out-of-scope threats and limitations

Rooted or OS-compromised devices, malicious system providers, physical forensic extraction, coercion and compromise of the user's external export destination are not fully mitigated. Hardware-backed Keystore behavior varies by device. Secure deletion from flash storage cannot be guaranteed. These exclusions must be disclosed and reviewed rather than described as solved.

## 8. Independent assessment requirement

This is an engineering model, not an independent security assessment, penetration test, certification or risk acceptance. A qualified assessor must review the exact release artifact and source, report findings, verify remediation and document residual risk. No patient/clinical workflow may be enabled on the basis of this document.
