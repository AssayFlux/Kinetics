# Track G implementation audit — 2026-11-12

**Audit type:** repository implementation and automated-control audit  
**Audit status:** IN PROGRESS — not a Track G closure or independent assurance report  
**Repository:** `AssayFlux/Kinetics`, branch `main`  
**Evidence baseline at report creation:** `d0ab281cbdbb6156e58fcca92373ab301c78316a`  
**Sequence:** R → S → I → P → G → U (D-023)

## 1. Executive result

The G0–G7 engineering framework is present in the repository and now has automated structural checks. The audit found and corrected two implementation defects during CI:

1. A Ruff line-length failure in the claims generator.
2. A stale claims CSV that included UI catalogue records in addition to executable tool capabilities. The generator's intended scope is the registry's `tools` collection; the corrected matrix contains **68 tool capabilities**, not 130.

The latest exact-head workflow for the evidence baseline above, [#43140079689](https://github.com/AssayFlux/Kinetics/actions/runs/43140079689), was pending when this report was prepared. Therefore this report does **not** claim exact-head CI success. The preceding run [#43139734705](https://github.com/AssayFlux/Kinetics/actions/runs/43139734705) confirmed Ruff, mypy, registry validation and the governance structure checker passed, but failed the claims-matrix reproducibility check before the scope correction. Its Android build was still running. The older run [#43136845552](https://github.com/AssayFlux/Kinetics/actions/runs/43136845552) had passed the Android arm64 APK/AAB build, JVM tests, dependency evidence capture and scientific/engine smoke jobs, but failed Python linting before the lint correction.

**Conclusion:** G engineering implementation is substantial but not yet verified on the final exact head. Track G remains OPEN.

## 2. Implemented repository controls

| Work package | Repository evidence | Current engineering status |
|---|---|---|
| G0 Governance | Control/evidence register, 8-row requirements map, roles/cadence, status vocabulary | Draft controls implemented; owner policy acceptance and role appointments open |
| G1 Security | Canonical app threat model, UI supplement, 16-case verification matrix, SECURITY.md and response procedure | Engineering specification implemented; device/fuzz/private-channel and independent assessment open |
| G2 Supply chain | 16-row dependency decision register, source SPDX inventory, Gradle/Cargo dependency reports and artifact hashes in Android CI | Partial inventory; Python wheel/plugin completeness, full SBOM and license decisions open |
| G3 Quality | Traceability checker, CAPA template, release checklist and CI checks | Structural controls implemented; QMS applicability, actual reviews and operating records open |
| G4 Privacy | 8-flow source-level data inventory and privacy/security requirements | Source inventory only; merged manifest, device/provider tests and qualified advice open |
| G5 Scientific integrity | Generated 68-tool capability claims matrix and registry-to-matrix checks | Claims are conservatively scoped; independent truth sets, subgroup analysis and scientific validation open |
| G6 Publication | Claim-evidence ledger and publication integrity protocol | Protocol implemented; author approvals, literature review and peer/editor decisions open |
| G7 Operations | Incident, stop-work, rollback, access, backup/recovery procedures and five tabletop scenarios | Procedure templates only; operators and exercises open |

## 3. Automated coverage

- **30 control IDs** across G0–G7 are enumerated in the control register and mapped in requirements traceability.
- **8 G requirement rows** map to the control IDs, artifacts, verification approach and remaining limitations.
- **16 security verification cases** have unique stable IDs; their statuses remain OPEN or PARTIAL until actual evidence is attached.
- **68 tool capabilities** are generated from `capabilities/registry.yaml`'s `tools` collection. Every row keeps validation, device and license status explicit; the matrix does not convert implementation into scientific validation.
- **16 dependency decision rows** explicitly distinguish candidate versions from approved redistribution. Blank hashes or UNASSIGNED reviewers remain unresolved rather than inferred.
- CI runs the governance structure checker and verifies that the generated claims matrix is reproducible.

The checks validate document/register integrity. They do not establish that security, privacy, scientific, legal, device or operational controls have passed.

## 4. Open findings and non-delegable evidence

| Finding | Required evidence | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Exact-head CI | All required jobs pass on one final main SHA; failures fixed and rerun | G0/G3 |
| Dependency completeness | Resolved Gradle plugins/modules, Cargo, Python wheels and build tools tied to exact APK/AAB hashes; complete SPDX/CycloneDX coverage | G2 |
| Redistribution rights | Qualified file/artifact/data/model license review and explicit decisions for each intended bundle | G2 |
| Device security/privacy | Merged manifests, physical-device tests, URI lifecycle, Keystore, logging, WebView and traffic evidence | G1/G4 |
| Independent security | Qualified assessor report, remediation and independent retest | G1 |
| Privacy/legal/QMS | Qualified jurisdiction-specific advice and QMS applicability determination | G3/G4 |
| Scientific validation | Independent reviewers, governed truth sets, pre-specified protocols, uncertainty and subgroup/missingness reports | G5 |
| Publication integrity | Reproducible literature review, actual author/contribution/COI declarations and exact claim evidence | G6 |
| Operational readiness | Named operators; dated incident tabletop, access review and backup/recovery exercises | G7 |
| Owner decisions | Governance-policy acceptance and documented residual-risk/release decisions within lawful scope | G0/G7 |

The repository owner is identified as the owner role. Security, scientific, privacy, quality, data, engineering, release and publication roles remain UNASSIGNED. Implementers cannot self-appoint as independent reviewers.

## 5. Safety and scope boundaries

- P0 remains **BLOCKED / NOT APPROVED**.
- No patient/clinical data, identifiable human-subject activity, individual clinical/PGx interpretation, diagnosis, treatment/dosing recommendation or Clinical Mode.
- No unreviewed engine, model, dataset or guideline content is approved for product bundling.
- CI APK/AAB builds are engineering/debug evidence, not signed production releases.
- Synthetic/software-reference concordance is not biological or clinical validation.
- Track U remains after G under D-023; existing U0–U3 material is retained as prior partial work and is not accepted complete.

## 6. Exit decision

**G0–G7 engineering framework:** implemented at draft/partial maturity.  
**Exact-head automated verification:** pending for the report baseline; prior attempts exposed and corrected defects.  
**Independent/external and operational evidence:** open.  
**Track G closure:** NOT APPROVED / OPEN.

Do not mark G closed or start the next sequential U implementation until the exact-head software gate is verified, the owner reviews the engineering scope, and the outstanding G acceptance requirements are either completed or explicitly carried as non-waivable release blockers. Legal, ethics, independent review and other qualified external determinations cannot be replaced by repository edits or owner permission.
