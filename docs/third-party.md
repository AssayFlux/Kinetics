# Third-party software and data register

No third-party scientific engine, model or database is approved for product bundling. Chaquopy and its scientific package dependencies are configured only in the isolated R1 feasibility prototype; they are not production selections.

| Component | Version | Source | License | Use | Approval/status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pytest, PyYAML, Ruff, mypy, pre-commit | Ranges in requirements-dev.txt / hook revision in config | PyPI and pre-commit hook repository | Upstream terms require review before distribution | Development and CI only | Not bundled in app; audit required before release |

Before adoption, pin an exact version/revision; record canonical source and upstream license; assess redistribution, modification, attribution, patent and network obligations; flag GPL/AGPL or restrictive terms for explicit owner review; record data provenance, consent and update policy.

The project license decision is Apache-2.0 (D-001), and the canonical LICENSE text is present at the repository root. This does not approve any third-party component for product distribution.

## PGx data governance — source gate

No PharmVar, PharmGKB, CPIC or other PGx content is currently bundled. Before importing definitions or guideline content, record the exact release/download URL, retrieval date, SHA-256 checksum (required by the importer), genome build, schema mapping, attribution and redistribution terms. Review each source's current terms rather than assuming that publicly viewable content is freely redistributable. Keep allele-definition data distinct from clinical guideline recommendations; require independent curator review and release-specific concordance before marking any entry validated. No patient-level interpretation is enabled.


## Reproducible local build toolchain pins

- Gradle 8.13 binary distribution SHA-256: 20f1b1176237254a6fc204d8434196fa11a4cfb387567519c61556e8710aed78 (official Gradle checksum reference).
- Chaquopy 17.2.0 source commit: 1f63c93d8beaf7062fbe51888ab9235475df3bb8.
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.13.2; Kotlin 2.2.21; NDK 28.2.13676358; JDK 17; SDK platform 36; Build Tools 36.0.0; CMake 3.22.1.
- Biopython 1.88 and NumPy 1.26.2 are pinned in the prototype. The custom Biopython wheel build is source-pinned, but the downloaded NumPy wheel still needs an independently pinned checksum and a current 16 KB page-size compatibility review.
- These pins improve reproducibility; they do not constitute a full dependency lock, transitive license audit, SBOM or local build-success claim.
- Gradle checksum source: https://gradle.org/release-checksums/


## SBOM generation

Run `python scripts/generate_source_sbom.py --output sbom/source-dependencies.spdx.json` to create an SPDX 2.3 inventory of declared direct dependencies. This deliberately marks unresolved versions and license conclusions as NOASSERTION and does not include resolved transitive Gradle artifacts, downloaded wheel hashes, native binary contents or file-level license results. It is an engineering inventory only, not the final release SBOM. The release checklist still requires a fully resolved transitive SBOM.


## RDKit adapter status

An optional source adapter exists at python/kinetics/chemistry_rdkit.py. It imports RDKit lazily and reports the active engine version; it is not a bundled dependency and is not used by the Android app. Before adoption, pin an exact compatible release, capture the full transitive dependency graph, audit notices/licenses at file and binary level, evaluate Android arm64/16 KB compatibility and benchmark binary footprint. The core RDKit project license is BSD-3-Clause, but that does not settle the licenses of all bundled dependencies or contributed components.


## HTSlib/pysam adapter status

A lazy host-side adapter at python/kinetics/genomics_htslib.py supports streaming BAM/CRAM through pysam/HTSlib. CRAM requires a local reference FASTA; remote reference retrieval is not enabled. pysam/HTSlib is not an Android dependency. Before adoption, pin exact pysam/HTSlib releases, audit bundled htslib/zlib and platform-specific licenses, verify native arm64 and 16 KB compatibility, and measure binary footprint. No Android bundling approval is implied.


## PharmVar data source review

PharmVar documents bulk database downloads containing per-gene haplotype TSV, FASTA and VCF files. Its TSV records are one row per haplotype/variant and coordinates are relative to the stated reference sequence; reference/*1 alleles use a special REFERENCE sentinel. The PharmVar data source is identified in HL7 terminology as CC BY-SA 4.0; retain attribution and ShareAlike terms in any separately distributed PharmVar data pack. Current PharmVar site version observed during this review: 6.2.29 (last updated 2026-09-22). Structural rearrangements and large deletions are not included in the downloadable allele definitions described on the download page. Recheck the live source release, terms and gene-specific change logs before each import.

- Native Rust toolchain: rustc/cargo 1.88.0 pinned by rust-toolchain.toml; android arm64 target pinned; Cargo.lock committed and local build uses --locked.

- Biopython 1.88 source is obtained from the immutable Git commit d7e4b8b19399668b09442a5b35765d9186b5f665, exported with git archive and built from a local recipe path instead of resolving a mutable PyPI sdist at build time. Biopython's PyPI metadata uses LicenseRef-Biopython-License-Agreement; include its upstream LICENSE/terms and review wheel redistribution before release.


## Biopython license notice

Biopython 1.88 is built from immutable source commit d7e4b8b19399668b09442a5b35765d9186b5f665. Its upstream LICENSE states the default license is the Biopython License Agreement, with some individual files dual-licensed under that agreement or BSD-3-Clause. The complete upstream LICENSE is reproduced in android/app/src/main/assets/third-party/BIOPYTHON-LICENSE.txt for the app's binary distribution notice. Individual file headers and all other runtime/transitive dependencies still require review.

- Biopython source pin: https://github.com/biopython/biopython/commit/d7e4b8b19399668b09442a5b35765d9186b5f665 (release 1.88). PyPI release page lists the sdist checksum, but the Android build uses the exact Git source commit rather than a mutable package index lookup.


## Host-only validation dependency inventory

The pinned NumPy/SciPy host comparison environment in
`validation/requirements-scipy.txt` is included in the generated declared
dependency SPDX inventory. These packages are validation-host tools only and
are not Android runtime dependencies. The CI workflow uploads the regenerated
direct-dependency inventory for each commit. License conclusions remain
`NOASSERTION` until exact upstream notices and all transitive artifacts are
reviewed; this artifact is not the release SBOM.


## S8 translation-table reference check

The pinned host-only Biopython 1.88 comparison in
`validation/requirements-biopython.txt` and
`validation/genetic_code_biopython_reference.py` checks all 64 codons and the
start/stop sets for the five explicitly implemented tables. Biopython is already
a pinned Android prototype dependency; the validation requirement shares that
version but does not approve any additional runtime dependency. The SPDX
generator records both usage contexts. This check is not evidence of organism
identification or genetic-code inference.


## Host-only RDKit validation pin

`validation/requirements-rdkit.txt` pins RDKit 2025.9.4 for the I1 descriptor
sanity job only. The core RDKit project license is BSD-3-Clause, but this host
wheel is not bundled in the Android app; transitive wheel components and their
notices still require a complete audit before any distribution or product use.
