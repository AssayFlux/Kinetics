# Track I — Software implementation and integration audit

**Disposition: SOFTWARE CLOSED · REAL-WORLD ACCEPTANCE OPEN**

- Audit date: 2026-11-11
- Repository: `AssayFlux/Kinetics`
- Exact audited main revision: `aabe37808a5494acb2171b6ed71d2661b4dd2453`
- Exact-head CI: [GitHub Actions #42970328048](https://github.com/AssayFlux/Kinetics/actions/runs/42970328048)
- CI result: completed, success, **9/9 jobs passed**

## Scope and decision

The documented I1–I5 software scope is implemented to the current research-only boundary and audited for cross-component contracts, bounded inputs/outputs, provenance, schema enforcement, regression coverage and Android/host integration. The exact-head CI pass is the acceptance evidence for this software checkpoint. No further I-track software blocker was identified in this bounded audit that prevents moving to the next planned track.

This closes the **current software scope**; it does not promise that no future defect or enhancement will ever be needed. Defects found later must be fixed under normal regression/CI controls. Expanded scientific capabilities require a separate roadmap increment.

## Component audit

| Area | Software implementation reviewed | Automated evidence | Real acceptance still open |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 chemistry | Host RDKit sanitization/descriptors/Morgan fingerprints; bounded Android SDF/MOL graph-only preview; provenance and explicit limitations | Pinned ethanol/benzene references, Python tests, Android integration contract and JVM/build checks | Broader curated chemistry references; named-device import/runtime; Android RDKit ABI/size/licence decision |
| I2 docking | Bounded prepared-PDBQT Vina 1.2.7 runner; protocol/input/engine/pose hashes; strict result schema; disabled-by-default authenticated Node worker | Vina engine smoke, Node worker security tests, schema/contract tests | Independent redocking/cross-docking RMSD and decoy enrichment; approved secure-node deployment; full transitive binary SBOM/licence review |
| I3 molecular dynamics | OpenMM 8.6.1 CPU runner for trusted constructed systems; bounded independent replicas/DCD; deterministic signed-32-bit seeds; provenance | Synthetic harmonic two-particle smoke and seed-boundary regression tests | Approved biomolecular force-field/parameter sources; biomolecular stability/energy/convergence and independent references; secure compute |
| I4 PK/PD and ADMET | One-compartment oral PK and Emax references; scaffold-group splitting; binary metrics/calibration; Tanimoto applicability-domain utilities; metadata-only source catalogue | SciPy DOP853 comparisons; RDKit utility smoke; deterministic/schema/edge-case tests | Approved data licences/intake; trained model; external held-out validation; PBPK remains outside implemented scope |
| I5 cohort/effect simulation | Seeded synthetic Hardy–Weinberg counts and caller-supplied additive effects; aggregate-only output contract | Determinism, count conservation, schema, bounds and aggregate-only tests | Governed real cohort intake, population/fairness/portability review and independent effect-model validation |

Android artifact bundle: [workflow artifact 13832813087](https://github.com/AssayFlux/Kinetics/actions/runs/42970328048/artifacts/13832813087), 80,653,407 bytes.

## Open real-world tests and approvals

These remain explicitly open and must not be represented as completed by CI:

- **I1:** expanded independently curated chemistry references; physical Android device installation, SAF import/export, runtime and lifecycle checks; Android RDKit packaging/licence decision.
- **I2:** independent redocking/cross-docking and decoy enrichment; deployed secure node; complete transitive binary/model/dependency provenance and licence review.
- **I3:** selected/licensed biomolecular force fields and parameter sources; representative biomolecular stability, energy conservation, timestep/equilibration/replica convergence and independent reference review.
- **I4:** approved/licensed dataset intake, trained-model provenance, leakage-controlled external holdout and independent performance/calibration review. No clinical/dosing use.
- **I5:** governance for public cohorts, population/fairness/portability assessment and independent variant-effect validation.
- **Cross-cutting:** physical-device verification, full third-party licensing, security review and owner acceptance.

P0 remains blocked. Patient data, clinical workflows and Clinical Mode remain disabled.

## Next track

Track I software exit is closed. Track P is next in the approved R → S → I → P → G sequence, but remains **not started** pending its own preparation and P0-boundary review. Only public-data metadata and synthetic/non-patient preparation may proceed before P0; patient-related and clinical features remain blocked.
